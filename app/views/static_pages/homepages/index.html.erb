      <h2>Flipped Classroom</h2>
      <p>
        The flipped classroom is a modern educational concept that revoles around a simple yet clever idea: the theory part is taught at home, with the help of videos, text, etc, and the homework is done in the classroom.
        This frees the teachers from traditional lectures and gives them more time to focus on the individual needs of each student.<br>
        Saaga is developed to allow an easy  and efficient implementation of this concept.
