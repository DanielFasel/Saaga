# SAAGA


## Helpful commands

Server commands:
- `rails s` or `rails server` is used to start the rails server. This allows the site to be accessible at `localhost:3000`.
- `./bin/webpack-dev-server` starts the NodeJs server for the SPA's (Singe Page Apps).

Database commands:
- `rails db:drop`
- `rails db:create`
- `rails db:migrate`
- `rails db:seed`

Test commands:
- `rails test`

Scaffold commands:
- `rails g`

These are just some of the commands I used the most. There are more commands that might prove useful so I highly suggest to read the Ruby on rails documentation for more information.
